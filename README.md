# QUESTIONS
1. Why are you not even transparent enough to open GitHub issues for everyone to discuss?
2. Why did you prefer an inferior solution over a superior solution (https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf)?
3. You claim that users are anonymous from a central authority. But that is a lie because your solution requires trust in the authority. Why do you lie? https://nadim.computer/posts/2020-04-17-pepppt.html

# CONCLUSION
You are traitors.
